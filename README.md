#Sample-Theater-Space

TECHNOLOGIES USED: ReactJS, TailwindCSS, and C# combined with Crestron Simpl Sharp Pro #.

This application simulates a control panel in a theater space for Audio and Video Control with a Crestron Virtual Control Processor. 
This is just a simulation so currently the backend feedback is only simulated.
In the actual deployment there would be communication from the Control Processor and the site.
